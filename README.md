## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anwesa-s/linux-secure-scripts.git
cd linux-secure-scripts
```
2. Make all scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```
3. Run each scripts:
```bash
sudo ./disable-root-ssh.sh
sudo ./enable-root-ssh.sh
sudo ./enable_ufw.sh
sudo ./auto-update-upgrade.sh
sudo ./user_make.sh
```
💡 Pro tip: Always test scripts on a virtual machine before deploying to a real server.
🧪 Script Details
1. `disable-root-ssh.sh`
Disables SSH login for the root user by modifying /etc/ssh/sshd_config, then restarts the SSH service.
1.1 `enable-root-ssh.sh`
Enables SSH login for the root via the backup file, then restart the SSH service.

3. `enable_ufw.sh`
Installs UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), sets secure default rules, and allows only SSH traffic.

4. `auto-update-upgrade.sh`
Updates and upgrades system packages using APT. Automate this with cron for regular updates.

5. `user_make.sh`
Prompts for a username, creates a user, sets a password, and adds the user to the sudo group.
